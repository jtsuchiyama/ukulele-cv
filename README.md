# Ukulele Chord Recognition

This repository is an adaptation of Paulden's Guitar Fingering Recognition work. I do not claim ownership for any of his work. Personal changes properly detect the location of fingers and chord building using mingus. 

## How to run

- `full_test.py`: runs all features to locate the strings, frets, notes, and chords
